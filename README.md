# cwRsync
This cwRsync script is used to sync (archive) data from a QNAP NAS to an external TerraMaster DAS so that the data can be backed up to a Backblaze WIndows computer backup (Backblaze will not backup mapped network drives but it will back up USB and Thunderbolt direct attached storage). Windows does not have any native rsync capbilities.
